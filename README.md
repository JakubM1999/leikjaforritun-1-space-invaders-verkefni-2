Welcome to the teaching materials for **Project 2: Space Invaders** in the Game Programming 1 course (*FORR2GL05DU*).

This project builds upon the foundations laid in the Pong project, introducing intermediate Godot concepts required to manage complex interactions between multiple game objects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, students will master:

*   **📡 Signals:** Implementing decoupled communication between nodes (e.g., detecting when a bullet hits a wall).
*   **👥 Groups:** Efficiently managing and controlling large numbers of entities (e.g., moving an entire alien army).
*   **🎲 Randomness (Slembilukka):** Using RNG for gameplay variety, such as unpredictable enemy shooting.
*   **⏱️ Timers:** Managing cooldowns and game pacing.
*   **Instancing:** Dynamically spawning scenes (bullets and enemies) at runtime.

## 📂 Content Structure

The course is delivered as a set of interactive, web-based slides with a retro **80s Arcade** aesthetic.

| **`images/`** | Contains Godot node icons and assets used in the slides. |
| **`videos/`** | Video demonstrations of specific steps (where applicable). |

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Navigate to the `Work/space-invaders-course/` directory.
2.  Open **`index.html`** in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  Navigate through the slides using the on-screen buttons or **Arrow Keys**.

> **Note:** While this README is in English, the course content within the slides is written in **Icelandic** 🇮🇸 to match the language of instruction.

## 🎨 Aesthetic

The slides feature a custom **Neon Arcade** theme (`style.css`) including:
*   Parallax Starfield background.
*   Global CRT scanline and vignette overlay.
*   Neon Cyan (`#00ffff`) and Magenta (`#ff00ff`) color palette.
*   No opaque containers—content sits directly on the animated starfield.
